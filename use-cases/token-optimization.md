# Use Case: Token Optimization for LLM Applications

## Scenario
A developer building an LLM-powered chat application needs to optimize token usage to reduce costs and improve performance while maintaining quality responses.

## Problem Statement
- API costs are high due to inefficient token usage
- Need to track and analyze token consumption patterns
- Must stay within model context limits
- Want to optimize prompt engineering for better token efficiency

## Solution Approach

### 1. Token Analysis
```typescript
import { ChatTokenCounter } from '../src/lib/token-counter';

const counter = new ChatTokenCounter('gpt-4');

// Analyze conversation token usage
const conversation = [
  { role: 'system', content: 'You are a helpful assistant...' },
  { role: 'user', content: 'How do I optimize my code?' },
  { role: 'assistant', content: 'Here are some optimization strategies...' }
];

const tokens = counter.countMessages(conversation);
console.log(`Conversation uses ${tokens} tokens`);
```

### 2. Cost Monitoring
- Track token usage per conversation
- Calculate costs in real-time
- Set budget alerts and limits
- Optimize system prompts for efficiency

### 3. Context Management
- Implement conversation summarization when approaching limits
- Use token counting to determine when to truncate history
- Prioritize recent messages over older ones

## Expected Outcomes
- 30-50% reduction in token costs
- Better user experience with faster responses
- Improved context awareness in conversations
- Data-driven prompt optimization

## Implementation Steps
1. Integrate token counter into chat pipeline
2. Add cost tracking and alerting
3. Implement context window management
4. Create optimization feedback loops
